How to make Vegetarian Mexican Quesadilla Recipe
To begin making the Vegetarian Roasted Carrot Zucchini Quesadilla Recipe, heat a heavy bottomed pan on medium flame , add a teaspoon of oil and the chopped garlic, bell peppers, carrots and zucchini.

Sprinkle salt and stir fry until the zucchini and carrots are softened and cooked through.

Once cooked, add the tabasco sauce, stir in the coriander leaves.

Allow the roasted carrot and zucchini to cool down a bit.

Place the tortillas on a flat surface, spoon the roasted vegetable mixture into one half of the tortilla, spoon a good amount of cheese over the vegetables and close the quesadillas to form a half moon shape.

Smear some softened butter or olive oil on the top and place the stuffed quesadillas on a preheated skillet. Cook on both sides by applying butter/ olive oil until browned and crisp.

Once done, cut the Vegetarian Roasted Carrot Zucchini Quesadilla into quarters and serve for a quick weeknight dinner. 

Serve Vegetarian Mexican Quesadilla along with the lettuce, Mexican Salsa, Yogurt Dip, and Guacamole for a wholesome dinner.
